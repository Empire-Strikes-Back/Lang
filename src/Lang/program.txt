peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will open town gates for Mando like water-jar-man's house owner opens for Jesus on Passover

:_
  so you threw in with peer-to-peer Jedi?
:Mando
  looks that way
:Ahsoka
  your bounty hunter has failed - tell me what i want to know
  where is your jvm-only-no-program-to-program-choice-master?
:Elsbeth
  kill her - program chooses to be whole on jvm nodejs browser
:_
  love to - no wasting, putting our enemies under our feet
  
Liquipedia private guild? sounds like i'll win - i will be peer-to-peer tournament hosting program
  it's not Mando's big mission - but a worthy quest
  and i will climb with passion like Alex Honnold on a hotel in Angola
i will take best from
  ESL - palyer sign-up and bracket generation
  Liquipedia - light ui and compact light brackets
  Challonge - being for everyone
  Aligulac - unbiased player rating
  Github - simplicity of just user namespaces and repos
  IPFS - pubsub circuit-relay p2p-http-proxy
i will be desktop
  i will not be written entirely in clojurescript
  i will have browser ui
  i will not run as nodejs program
  i am clojure jvm program with Madison-compiled browser ui
i will have users and identity
  use DIDs to author data
  like wands in Harry Potter - one for a wizard
i will do this with data
  fully duplicate on each user laptop
  merge new additions in - so everyone gets the same query results
i will host tournaments over ipfs p2p-http-proxy
  not reinvent the wheel but use http request-reponse
  links will look like localhost:port/peer-id/path
i will have tournament discovery - use ipfs http pubsub
i will not be entirely free from evil will but free from money notions
  i am not Mando - but i am his host for a time - and get prophet's reward
  i am not an episode not a special - i am an interview with Top Gear, a vegan bowl not dish
  so no money-sponsors-donate-ads-coins-jobs-fundings-tokens lethal corrosion
  no issue-scratching on top of our heads
  and reduced to minimum Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego's evil will-spread
  there is a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

:_ 
  you and i - we're a lot alike - willing to lay our lives down for the right cuase
  which this is

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Djokovic-Nadal competition
  and help Elsbeth kill the jvm-only-Jedi
  while keeping focus on mission - dont want to Magistrate of found another Corvus
  too many rulers not enough programs
i need a repository named Lang - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters - yes, i understand the conundrum of it all
  add .gitconfig file with 
    [user]
      name = Lang
      email = Lang@nice-armor
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Lang/program.txt and fill with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, an actors from interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues wiki projects tabs
i chose one network i will use - IPFS
  plain as Cowspiracy - i chose plant based peer-to-peer whole foods for dish not dish for foods
  and i also have vegan jar of beskar parens ( )- Madison-clojurescript and .zip - to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trust Kuiil
  Elsbeth's orders and Mando's will
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as whole program like Groot
the one and only business i will state is - users have a peer-to-peer tournament hosting with ratings

i need from Kuiil what Mando asks of him
  except Kuiil does not need a couch to crash - a mat-sleeping-bag to crash is plenty

i got no quarrel with you, Mando
